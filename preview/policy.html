         <p>
           <ul>
             <li>We don’t ask you for personal information unless we truly need it. (We can’t stand services that ask you for things like your gender or income level for no apparent reason.)</li>
             <li>We don’t share your personal information with anyone except to comply with the law, provide services to you, develop better products &/or services, or protect our rights</li>
             <li>We don’t store personal information on our servers unless required for the on-going operation of one of our services.</li>
           </ul>
         </p>

         <p>
           It is New York Surveyor’s policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect while operating our website.

Below is our Privacy Policy which incorporates these goals:
         </p>

         <h1>Website Visitors</h1>
         <p>Like most website operators, <a class="normal-link" href="http://www.newyorksurveyor.com/">New York Surveyor</a> collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. New York Surveyor’s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how New York Surveyor’s visitors use its website.</p>

         <p><a class="normal-link" href="http://www.newyorksurveyor.com/">New York Surveyor</a>also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users and for users leaving comments on our website.</p>

         <p><a class="normal-link" href="http://www.newyorksurveyor.com/">New York Surveyor</a> only discloses logged in user and commenter IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below, except that blog commenter IP addresses are visible and disclosed to the administrators of the blog where the comment was left.</p>
         
         <h1>Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information</h1>
         <p>Certain visitors to New York Surveyor’s website may choose to interact with <a class="normal-link" href="http://www.newyorksurveyor.com/">New York Surveyor</a> in ways that require <a class="normal-link" href="http://www.newyorksurveyor.com/">New York Surveyor</a> to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that <a class="normal-link" href="http://www.newyorksurveyor.com/">New York Surveyor</a> gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up for a service to provide a username and email address.</p>

         <p>
           In each case, <a class="normal-link" href="http://www.newyorksurveyor.com/">New York Surveyor</a> collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor’s interaction with <a class="normal-link" href="http://www.newyorksurveyor.com/">New York Surveyor</a>. <a class="normal-link" href="http://www.newyorksurveyor.com/">New York Surveyor</a> does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.
