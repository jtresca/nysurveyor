         <h1>Subdivision Platting</h1>
         <p>
         Platting is the process that guarantees that  the state, counties and municipalities can control the way they develop and grow.  This includes extending infrastructure ,roads and utilities.  The platting process insures that  when development happens it will conform  with local laws and rules. 
        </p>
         <p>
           Subdivision Plats  must be reviewed and approved by many entities - the city planners, utility companies, municipal districts, drainage districts, fire marshals  and finally by a city council  or the county court.  All plats should follow minimum standards to safeguard the public. 
         </p>
         <p>
           The law gives the smallest municipality the right to develop it own platting standards.   Platting is mandated by the state although it is administered by county  officials and local municipal officials.  All plats follow minimum standards to safeguard the public. Most platting requirements are set by local government. 
         </p>
         <p>
           Because local governments control the process and requirements for platting, the time it takes for platting varies widely. City councils or planning commissions may  meet weekly, bi-weekly, monthly and even less often.  Typically  both a preliminary and final plat is required.
         </p>
         <p>
           Each submission must be reviewed by planners, power companies, fire  marshals and whatever  various other entities the municipality feels should be consulted..  These processes can take weeks or even several months on large projects.  After the preliminary approval  has been reviewed by a planning commission, it goes county commissioners, city council or county court. 
         </p>
          <p>
            Sometimes utility construction can must be completed before the final plat can be  approved and recorded.  In moat some case no construction can begin  until after the plat is recorded.
          </p>
          <p>
            Please contact us to discuss your platting needs.
