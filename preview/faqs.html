        <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
        <p>We answer the questions that we read or hear customers ask us about the most.</p>

         <h1>What is Surveying?</h1>
         <p>Surveying or land surveying is the technique, profession and science of accurately determining the terrestrial or three-dimensional position of points and the distances and angles between them. These points are usually on the surface of the Earth, and they are often used to establish land maps and boundaries for ownership or governmental purposes.  To accomplish their objective, surveyors use elements of geometry, engineering, trigonometry, mathematics, physics, and law. </p><br>

         <h1>Is a survey really necessary?</h1>
         <p>A survey is necessary to protect your property rights. A survey will ensure that you acquire ownership for the land you are paying for. It will explicitly illustrate where your property begins and where it ends. It will also protect you from having anybody else infringe upon your property. Additionally, you will be protected in case there may be any violations of building restrictions (encroachments) on the subject property.</p>

         <h1>What areas of New York do you service?</h1>
         <p>Our primary coverage area is Westchester County and Rockland County.  However, we can and will handle surveys in other areas.  Please contact us with specifics.</p>

         <h1>How fast can I get my survey?</h1>
         <p>Simply put, we will meet your deadline. You tell us the date you need the survey and we will deliver it to you.</p>

         <h1>Are there Different Types of Surveys?</h1>
         <p>There are numerous "Types" of surveys.  It is difficult to say exactly how many different types of surveys there are since there are many ways to "categorize" surveys.  Surveys are sometimes categorized by based on HOW or WHERE the survey is performed.  Sometimes the survey type is delineated by the REASON a survey is performed.</p><br>

         <h1>How do I know what type of survey I need?</h1>
         <p>Sometimes it is obvious based on the reason you need the survey.  If you happen to need a survey, but are uncertain as to what type of survey you need, just call us.  It will just take a few minutes to figure it out.   The answers to a few questions (such as location of the property, purpose of the survey, who needs the survey and why, level of detail needed, etc.) will allow us to determine what type of survey is best suited to your needs.</p>

         <h1>What is a Closing Survey?</h1>
         <p>A Closing Survey (also known as a "Mortgage Survey" or "Lot Survey") is sometimes done prior to the purchase of real estate.  A Closing Survey may be done at the request of the bank, existing home-owner, prospective buyer, Realtor, attorney, title company or any other party involved in the purchase or finance of the property.</p>

        <p>The Closing Survey provides assurance to the lender and buyer that the property they are purchasing is what has been represented by the seller.</p><br>

        <h1>How is a Lot Survey done?</h1>
         <p>In the course of the survey the property corners will be found, if they have been disturbed they will be reset and marked with an iron pin and plastic cap bearing the surveyors registration number. If corners are not visible from one another, stakes may be placed on line between them if the owner asks for the lines to be marked.</p><br>
